# Parametric Sensor Box with Lid

Parametric sensor box supports:
 * **Entire box *and* lid** are generated using *your* specs.
 * PCB slides into a 0.5mm overhang. 
 * That combined with two hinge pins or "snap posts" for the mount holes on the opposite (top) side of the PCB hold it so securely that a lid is not needed. 
   
   (In fact, you must turn upside-down and "whack it on a hard surface", or use a tool to remove it!)
   
 * Two cables, one on each side of the box. (Originally designed for sensors that I'm chaining together.) 
 
   Currently, both (left and right) cable openings must be at the same offset.
   
   If you wanted no cables, this *should* work by entering 0 for the sizes.
 
 * Lid has posts on end that snap "vertically" into slots in the top of opposite sides of box.
 * Other side of lid then snaps into a small groove in the box. (On the side opposite the pin hinges.)
 * Sharing one plane with this groove is another cut that goes through to the top, in order to simplify opening the box. (With 0.5mm gap between parts, tolerances are tight, and so is the lid.)
 
 * Lid has a window in it. If you don't want a window, simply enter 0 for both "LidWindow" size parameters.
   
   It's barely large enough for a small tweezer, other tiny tool, or very small and strong fingernails to get it open! 
   
   **Note** that you *can* pry it open from either "side", above the cable openings by using a small screwdriver or tweezer, as well.

# Sizes *needed from your* PCB
You must measure your PCB (or look up sizes/calculate them). **Please *do not* contact me or enter an issue for sizes.** 
(I'm of no help if it's not here within a few weeks of original release, anyway. I do plan to upload one more fairly soon.)

You'll need a digital calliper/micrometer to measure these as precisely as possible. 
Note that if you get something like "3.98", please round-up to 4. ðŸ˜Š

## Sizes:
 * Please see screenshot (below) or simply open the file and Change Parameters and ask me if you have a question. It's fine to create an issue only for a question.
 * Do we need a Wiki?
